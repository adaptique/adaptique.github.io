## Core Technologies

### Programming Languages & Runtime
- **Rust**: Primary implementation language for chain logic and core systems
- **Tokio**: Asynchronous runtime for parallel chain processing
- **WebAssembly**: For client-side chain validation and processing

### Cryptography & Security
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Implementation for secure cross-chain validation
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Consensus mechanism across multiple chains
- **Atomic Operations**: For Base Pair Mechanism transactions

### Development Tools
- **Mermaid.js**: For architectural and flow diagrams
- **Rust Tools**:
  - Cargo: Package management
  - rustfmt: Code formatting
  - clippy: Linting
  - cargo-audit: Security auditing
