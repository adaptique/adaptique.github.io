## MVP Definition
The minimum viable product should demonstrate:

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Single operational chain
   - Basic cross-chain communication
   - Simple smart contract execution
   - Basic access control

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Transaction throughput: 100 TPS minimum
   - Cross-chain latency: < 5 seconds
   - WASM contract execution
   - Basic provider integration

3. **Development Priorities**
   - Security first
   - Clean interfaces
   - Extensible design
   - Good documentation

## Development Guidelines

### MVP Approach
1. Start with simplified implementations
2. Focus on core functionality
3. Use existing tools where possible
4. Regular security reviews
5. Continuous testing

### Technology Stack
- Rust for core implementation
- WASM for smart contracts
- Protocol Buffers for messaging
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Docker for deployment

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for all components
2. Integration tests for chain interactions
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Security audits
5. Testnet deployment

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team (MVP)
- 2-3 Core blockchain developers
- 1-2 WASM/Smart contract developers
- 1 DevOps engineer
- 1 Technical writer

### Infrastructure
- Development environment
- Testing infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation system

## Risk Mitigation
1. Regular security audits
2. Phased deployment approach
3. Comprehensive testing
4. Community feedback
5. Regular code reviews
